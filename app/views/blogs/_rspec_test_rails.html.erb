<p class="blog-text">Testing is super important! Everyone knows this and I really, seriously enjoy writing tests. I like figuring out what I should test and how to break down my app into pieces that I can test individually. In spite of these facts, I had not actually written very many tests for my Ruby on Rails apps. Then I thought, 'Hey, THIS is a Rails app! I'll write a bunch of tests for my own website, make sure I know how to test all the different aspects of the app and I'll document it all in a blog." (This is the blog part of that plan.)</p>

<p class="blog-text">The first thing I realized was that the minitest suite that Rails generated automatically is not the same as the Rspec test suite I'm used to. There was already a group in my gem file for gems that should apply for the development and test environments, so I added <code>gem "rspec-rails"</code> to that group and did a fresh <code>bundle install</code>. Then I ran <code>rails generate rspec:install</code> and Rails created a spec folder and a couple of helper files.</p>
